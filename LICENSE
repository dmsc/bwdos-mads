  BW-DOS may be freely used and distributed under following
  conditions:
  - Only the whole and unchanged master disk may be distributed,
  - It may not be sold, excepting little costs in PD services,
  - When used as a part of another software package, the whole package
    may be marked with a "(C)", sold etc.; in this case it's possible

    be unchanged, and an information where the whole BW-DOS is
    available must be included.
